    <h3>Que 1st. "Describe the main difference between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model. When would you choose to use one over the other." and the answer is below</h3>
    <p>The key difference between the Flexbox and CSS grid layout strategies and how they handle the arrangment of elements.
        <br> <br>
        <b>Flexbox:</b> is a primarily designed for one-dimensional layouts focusing on distributing space and aligning items along a single axis. It's best suited for layouts where you have a row and column of items , such as navigation menus , card-based designs , or centering content within a container. <br><br>
        <b>CSS grid:</b> is designed for two-dimensional layouts , allowing you to define both rows and columns . It creates a grid of cells where content can be placed in any cell or span across multiple cells. CSS Grid is ideal for complex grid-based designs like magazine layouts, forms , and any layout where content needs to be placed in a precise grid struture. <br><br>

        Choosing between Flexbos and CSS Grid depends on your specific layouts requirements . 
        <br><br>

        You might choose Flexbox when you need to arrange items along a single axis. For example, when creating navigation bars, header/footer layouts , or aligning elements within a container. Flexbos is great for responsive designs where items can vary in size.
        <br><br>
        You might choose CSS Grid when you need to create more complex, two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns. It's particularly useful when you have a grid-like structure, such as galleries, forms with multiple fields, or any design that requires precise control over both rows and columns.
        <br><br>
        In some cases, you may even combine both Flexbox and CSS grid within a single layout to leverage the strengths of each model for different parts of your webpage. <br><br><hr>
